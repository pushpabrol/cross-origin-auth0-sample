# node-co-auth0js-demo

This is a demo nodejs project to demonstrate cross origin auth.

## Setup

Rename .env.eaxmple to .env and update with your own values.

Remember you have to enable cross origin auth on the client first.

public/co-verify.html and public/silent-callback.html require you to manually set client id and tenant url in those pages, but these aren't required for basic CO auth functionality.
