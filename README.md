# node-co-auth0js-demo

This is a demo nodejs project to demonstrate cross origin auth.

## Setup

Rename .env.eaxmple to .env and update with your own values.

Make sure all the auth0 settings are valid
Remember you have to enable cross origin auth on the client first.

public/co-verify.html and public/silent-callback.html require you to manually set client id and tenant url in those pages, but these aren't required for basic CO auth functionality.

Change values
Save
npm install
npm start
